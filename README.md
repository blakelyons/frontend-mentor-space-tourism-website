## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - JS library
-   [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) - Vue Component Framework
-   [mdi/font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdi/font) - Material Design Fonts
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I used this project to try out Vuetify. I learned about the Vuetify Framework, however I mostly just used the Grid layout Component. I wanted to see what the workflow was like while using Vue with Vuetify.
